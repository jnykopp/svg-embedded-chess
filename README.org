* Chess embedded in SVG

  This is a silly project that embeds a chess engine that plays agaist
  itself in a self-contained SVG file.

  The engine is "P4wn" written by Douglas Bagnall
  (https://github.com/douglasbagnall/p4wn), version
  e4bb22926b288c4d8443d25466efb5f2e839ff66, which is licensed with CC0
  and is in the public domain.

  I have slightly modified this incarnation of P4wn and concatenated
  the code in one file.

  Point your browser to it and see it in action yourself! (If it
  doesn't animate, click on the image, then right-click and "View
  image" at least on Firefox.)
